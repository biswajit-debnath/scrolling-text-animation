# Step 2 Complete: CSS Styling and Layout

## What We Created:
- Complete CSS foundation for our scrolling text animation
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Dark theme optimized for dramatic animations
- Special styling for animated elements

## Key CSS Techniques Learned:

### 1. Responsive Typography with clamp()
```css
font-size: clamp(24px, 2.5vw, 60px);
```
- **Minimum**: 24px (mobile readability)
- **Preferred**: 2.5vw (scales with viewport)
- **Maximum**: 60px (prevents oversizing)

### 2. Perfect Centering with CSS Grid
```css
display: grid;
place-items: center;
```
- More efficient than flexbox for simple centering
- Works for both text and circular badges

### 3. Absolute Positioning for Badges
```css
position: relative; /* parent */
position: absolute; /* child */
right: -30px; /* positions outside parent boundary */
```

### 4. Animation-Ready Properties
- `opacity: 0` - Ready for fade-in animations
- `transform-origin: center` - Smooth scaling animations
- `position: relative` - Enables child positioning

## Files Created:
- Enhanced `style.css` with all necessary styling
- Detailed comments explaining each property's role

## CSS Structure:
1. **Universal Reset** - Clean foundation
2. **Body/HTML Setup** - Full height, dark theme
3. **Main Container** - Centering and layout
4. **Text Styling** - Responsive typography
5. **Highlights** - Special word styling
6. **Badge** - Animated circular element

## Next Step Preview:
Step 3 will involve JavaScript and GSAP to bring our styled elements to life with:
- SplitType for character splitting
- GSAP animations for text reveals
- ScrollTrigger for scroll-based timing
- Lenis for smooth scrolling

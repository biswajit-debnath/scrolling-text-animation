# Generic Project Learning Template - Micro-Step Approach with Detailed Documentation

## PROMPT TEMPLATE FOR FUTURE PROJECTS

### Project Setup Request Format:
```
I want to learn [TECHNOLOGY/FRAMEWORK/CONCEPT] by building a [PROJECT TYPE] project. 

Reference/Inspiration: [URL OR DESCRIPTION OF WHAT YOU WANT TO BUILD]

**Learning Requirements:**
- Break down into micro-steps (NOT full implementation at once)
- Add heavy comments and notes in code for future reference
- Create separate documentation files for each major step
- Explain WHY each technique is used, not just HOW
- Include detailed explanations of concepts as we go
- After each micro-step, YOU guide me to the next part with a short summary

**My Learning Flow Preference:**
1. You explain what needs to be done in the micro-step
2. I write the code and show you
3. You review, enhance with comments, and explain concepts
4. You provide summary and preview of next micro-step
5. Repeat until project is complete

**Project Structure I Want:**
- Step-by-step approach with clear progression
- Detailed code comments explaining every important line
- Separate notes files documenting what was learned
- Working examples that I can reference later
- Understanding of how different technologies work together

Please start by breaking down this project into major steps, then we'll tackle the first micro-step.
```
